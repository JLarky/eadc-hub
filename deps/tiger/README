Tiger Hash is now working as erlang application, so do

 $ make

 $ erl -pa ebin -boot start_sasl -s tiger
 Eshell V5.6.3  (abort with ^G)
 1> tiger:hash("tiger").
 [108,96,140,225,50,117,176,127,25,118,131,26,197,250,159,85,139,9,82,161,227,249,201,211]

hash() take string parameter and return Tiger Hash in 24-bytes string



I've tested it only in Lunux, more likely it will not work in Windows. If you can make it work there, your patches are very welcome.
