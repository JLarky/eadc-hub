Tiger Hash is now working as erlang application, so do

 $ make
 $ make tiger # Linux, Mac OS and so on
 $ make tiger-win # Windows-only

 $ erl -pa ebin -boot start_sasl -s tiger
 Eshell V5.6.3  (abort with ^G)
 1> tiger:hash("tiger").
 [108,96,140,225,50,117,176,127,25,118,131,26,197,250,159,85,139,9,82,161,227,249,201,211]

hash() take string parameter and return Tiger Hash in 24-bytes string



Troubleshooting:

If you've got "error: erl_driver.h: No such file or directory" than find this file somewhere like /usr/local/lib/erlang/usr/include/erl_driver.h or C:\Program Files\erl\usr\include and just copy to priv directory where files tiger.c and tiger_drv.c are located.


Requirements:
* erlang-otp
* gcc (MinGW)
* make
