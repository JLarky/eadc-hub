Troubleshooting:

If you got "error: erl_driver.h: No such file or directory" when run make.
Do "locate erl_driver.h" and then "sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/erlang/usr/include/erl_driver.h /usr/include/erl_driver.h" replace /usr/local/lib/erlang/usr/include/erl_driver.h to path of erl_driver.h in your system
